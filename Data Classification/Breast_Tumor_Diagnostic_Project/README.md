This project was meant to classify whether a tumor was Malignant (M) or Beneign (B) based off of various characteristics. This dataset has 3 key segments of the key characteristics (mean, standard error (se), and worst), so I ran a random forest classifier on the whole overall data (shown above) and for each characteristic (shown below). Overall, if you could not get your hands on one characteristic or another, both the worst and mean would be good choices since they preformed very well, sometimes better than the overall data depending on the run. The standard error of the characteristics, on the other hand, was a poor preformer and may have been the wrench that caused the overall dataset option to preform worse on some runs.
