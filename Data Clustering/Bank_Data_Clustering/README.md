The point of this project was to analyze this dataset that I found while browsing Kaggle, which I just felt compelled to work with after looking at it.

The project uses KMeans and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to split bank Balance, Purchase, and Payments data into clusters. These attribributes were selected by me as the strongest to analyze after experimenting with the other 15 factors and considering the important points of a bank. After experimenting with clustering properties and coming to a viable cluster set, I found the average of each characteristic for each cluster to define the clusters as people, being the  less engaged (lower in all fronts), the heavy spenders (high spending and credit payments, but a medium amount held by the bank as a balance), and the savers (high balances for purchases, but less spending in the form of purchases and payments).
